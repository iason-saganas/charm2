All figures show the charm2 reconstructions using DESY5 data.
All exhibits used 6 global KL-iteration runs.

exhibitA
------------
Data was not manipulated.

exhibitB
------------
Supernova magnitudes z > 0.55 were all decreased by 0.5.
This shows that lower SN magnitudes at high redshifts exaggerate the bump.


exhibitC
------------
Supernova magnitudes z > 0.55 were all increased by 0.04.
This shows that the high-z upwards bump persists, although a new trough is introduced at x=0.44.
So maybe, instead of increasing high-z SN mags, we should decrease low-z SN mags?


exhibitD
------------
Supernova magnitudes z < 0.55 were all decreased by 0.04.
This corrects the low-z SNe, but there is still a trough at z=0.55. It looks like this trough is  what the data persists on.


exhibitE
------------
Subtracting 0.04 in general from the data does not lead to a change in form, just an offset.

exhibitF
------------
Supernova magnitudes z > 0.55 were all increased by 0.008.
This shows that a dispersion of this order of magnitude has only marginal effects on the reconstruction. Maria Vincenzi et al. found that this difference in magnitudes remains unexplained in the comparison of the Pantheon+ and DESY5 SN compilations (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06664 and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07175)


Conclusion:
------------
No naive subtraction / addition of SN magnitudes removes the bump of the reconstruction.
Of course if there are indeed unknown systematics, as previously discussed, a change in the covariance matrix would have a large and non-linear impact on the reconstructions. On a physical level, the sudden increase in slope happens well before matter-dark-energy equality and could be an indication of poor constraining power of SN data alone on the shape of curve.
